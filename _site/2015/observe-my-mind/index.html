        <p>I&#39;ve been recently practicing observing my mind. It&#39;s simple. Just sit tight and write down whatever is in your mind. This afternoon, I experienced something interesting which I believe will help me to find out what&#39;s happening to me lately. </p>

<p>That is, I wrote something I didn&#39;t even notice until I finished it. That sentence is </p>

<blockquote>
<p>YOU ARE GOING TO FAIL ANYWAY</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s very not cool. It&#39;s deep in my mind, really. Almost for my whole life I&#39;ve been thinking about who I am, what I&#39;m going to be, what do I want to do, can I do better...all the stupid questions like that. </p>

<p>I once did. I once got to know who I am going to be, what I am going to do. It didn&#39;t hold for long, unfortunately. Then I got sucked into this black hole called life, or reality or whatever it is. </p>

<p>The fact is, I&#39;m dumb, I&#39;m lazy, I&#39;m flawful. I&#39;m not the one I once thought I would be. I have to admit that being stupid enough to believe I&#39;m the best one is really great, when I walk on the street, thinking all the eyes on me(not the kind when I hang out on street with my girl friend, in short pants, both of us yellow, in a none-yellow muslim country where tourists never visit) and how cool I was. I really enjoy that. In fact my idea life is simple: being a freelancer. That is exactly what I&#39;ve been trying for a long time. </p>

<p>However, when I put it this way, I feel ashamed -- the so called freedom is just a reason of not working hard cause I never think about price of freedom. I got stucked, in a trap I set for myself. If I can just stay foolish I once was, I could live a happy life. The problem is I can&#39;t concerntrate. My mind is like a drop of ink in the water, it never stays in a point, it expands.</p>

<p>Now you see me. Now you see where the point is. The only thing that has changed is you. You can&#39;t stay focused anymore. You&#39;d rather think about all those nonsense than do something, don&#39;t you?</p>

<p>Knock it off. I&#39;m tired... Just leave it, post it... That&#39;s it....</p>
