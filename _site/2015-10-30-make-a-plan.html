<p>What may come to your mind when this word heap comes to your mind? A data structure, or memory? Do you think the heap, in the memory, is organized in a heap structure? If you do, or literraly get confused, you should keep reading on.</p>

<p>As everyone knows, memory is managed in two ways, stack and heap. The stack is used for temporary variables created by functions in a FILO way, just like what stack(data structure) does. In this case, stack(memory) is organized in a stack(data structure) way. </p>

<p>So does heap? Not actually. </p>

<p>Heap(memory) is NOT organized in a heap(data structure) way. There’s no enforced pattern for the allocation and deallocation for heap. Being named heap doesn’t neccessary mean it’s organized in a heap way. </p>

<p>Why not call it another way? Whatever…</p>
