<p>I swear to god I have read this, figured this out thousands of times, yet I can’t recall any bit of it every time I come across it, therefore, as stupid as I might sound, I’m going to tape it damn it!!!</p>

<p>String maintains a pool therefore it’s immutable, therefore don’t put 
&gt;string += </p>

<p>in the loop otherwise it keeps creating new Strings damn it.</p>
