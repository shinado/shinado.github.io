<p>If youâ€™re a pro Aris user, you might have noticed thereâ€™s a cool plugin â€˜locatemeâ€™ which displays an image with your current location, like this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/image_locateme.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>What you may not have known is, when you tap the â€œsendâ€ button and share your location with a friend using Aris themes, with his/her notification turning on, he/she will be able to see your location in the console, just like this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/image_locate_feed.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Awesome, isnâ€™t it? Now use code â€˜locatemeâ€™ and share your location with your friend!</p>
