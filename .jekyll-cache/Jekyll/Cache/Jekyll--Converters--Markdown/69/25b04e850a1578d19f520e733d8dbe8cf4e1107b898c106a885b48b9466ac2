<p>In our latest release, cd and shell command is back!</p>

<p>Simply use ‘cd {file}’ to access to the folder/file; use ‘cd..’ to go back to parent folder, ‘exit’ to exit. And that’s it! Simple as that.</p>

<p>By using ‘shell’ you’ll be able to enter shell mode where you can use all shell commands. Simply use ‘exit’ to quit.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
