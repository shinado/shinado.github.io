<p>In this tutorial, weâ€™re going to show you Aris plugins, some of which are cool, others are pretty useful.</p>

<p><strong>clear</strong> enables you to clear all messages in home screen.</p>

<p><strong>restart</strong> apparently will reboot Aris. If things start getting weird, itâ€™s recommended to use this command to reboot Aris.</p>

<p><strong>apps</strong> takes you to a regular app list where you can find all apps, in an old fasion way. This works when you sometimes really canâ€™t find your app.</p>

<p><strong>config</strong> takes you to configuration page.</p>

<p><strong>store</strong> takes you to Aris store.</p>

<p><strong>torch</strong> toggle the flash.</p>

<p><strong>bluetooth</strong> toggle the bluetooth.</p>

<p>In order to enable notification display you need to both enable it in Aris and in Android systme. Firstly, go â€˜configâ€™ and enable notification.</p>

<p>After you enable notification in Aris configuration, youâ€™ll be directed to system notification settings. Now enable it for the Launcher you are using.</p>

<p>Â </p>

<p>Now, go back to home screen and if you see this notification, it means notifiaction has been successfully enabled:</p>

<p>Â

<p>Â </p>

<p>Apart from that, you can also change the styles of the notification in â€˜configâ€™. We have 3 notification styles available.</p>
