Indepedent developer, highly experinced in Android, practicing in iOS. 

You can check my [studio] to see what I've released, or fork me on [GitHub]. 

If you like me, read my [diary] to see what's going on everyday. 

I'm also the author to two books. Check [here](http://item.jd.com/11037613.html) and [here](http://item.jd.com/11544524.html) but do not buy them cause they are shitty. 

I make [resumes], occationaly(Notice I've got a CLIENT already). 

I travel around and take [photos] sometimes with my Korean girlfriend(If you have a job in China to offer her, please contact me). 

If you want to offer me a job, please [contact me][].
