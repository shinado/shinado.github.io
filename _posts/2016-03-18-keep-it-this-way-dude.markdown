There's no way to give a clear definition of right and wrong, especially when it comes to life(you're talking big). But there's one thing that everyone could be pretty sure -- being happy, right now. There's only one way to waste your life, which is by hesitating. I can not decide what's right or what's wrong but I can decide I'm happy NOW or not. That's critical. Better to be blind but confident than being open-minded but miserable. Dictatorship works out fine in many countries, namely, Taiwan, S.Korea, Singapore, and China if you may say. 

I've failed thousands of times but that's not what defines me. Now I see it. I will not be great, but at least I can be happy. One may say, you have no idea how good you're unless you give yourself a little bit push. That's bullshit....for me. I did couple of times and I crashed down, which is horrific. There are always things that you can do and some you can't. You'd better be damn clear about it.

This is right. Stay away from kickasses. Be blind. Be stupid. Be small.
