# Aris Tutorial - Plugins

In this tutorial, we're going to show you Aris plugins, some of which are cool, others are pretty useful. 

**clear** enables you to clear all messages in home screen. 

**restart** apparently will reboot Aris. If things start getting weird, it's recommended to use this command to reboot Aris.

**apps** takes you to a regular app list where you can find all apps, in an old fasion way. This works when you sometimes really can't find your app. 

**config** takes you to configuration page. 

**store** takes you to Aris store. 

**torch** toggles the flash. 

**bluetooth** toggles the bluetooth. 

**wifi** displays the wifi settings as a floating window, like this:

**locateme** displays a window shows your current location.
