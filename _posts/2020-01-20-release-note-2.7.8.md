# Release note 2.7.8

In our recent release, we improved directory mode with image/video thumbnails. When you use 'cd' and switch to a directory, images/videos will be displayed as thumbnails. If you are new to 'cd', simply type 'cd' and enter. After accept premissions, you'll be in directory mode, like this:

![](/assets/update_278_1.jpg)

&nbsp;

It's often the case your camera photos are stored in DCIM/Camera. Simply type 'dcim', then 'camera' to enter this directory, like this:

![](/assets/update_278_2.jpg)

&nbsp;


Now you'll be able to find your photos/videos in thumbnails:

![](/assets/update_278_3.jpg)

&nbsp;

Isn't it cool?

Oh if you wish to exit the directory mode, simply use 'exit'. 

&nbsp;
Cheers!
