# Aris Tutorial - Notification

In Aris, you can display notifications in the console, like this:

&nbsp;

In order to enable notification display you need to both enable it in Aris and in Android systme. Firstly, go 'config' and enable notification.

After you enable notification in Aris configuration, you'll be directed to system notification settings. Now enable it for the Launcher you are using.

Now, go back to home screen and if you see this notification, it means notifiaction has been successfully enabled:
