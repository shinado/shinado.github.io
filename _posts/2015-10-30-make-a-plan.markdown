What may come to your mind when this word heap comes to your mind? A data structure, or memory? Do you think the heap, in the memory, is organized in a heap structure? If you do, or literraly get confused, you should keep reading on.

As everyone knows, memory is managed in two ways, stack and heap. The stack is used for temporary variables created by functions in a FILO way, just like what stack(data structure) does. In this case, stack(memory) is organized in a stack(data structure) way. 

So does heap? Not actually. 

Heap(memory) is NOT organized in a heap(data structure) way. There's no enforced pattern for the allocation and deallocation for heap. Being named heap doesn't neccessary mean it's organized in a heap way. 

Why not call it another way? Whatever...
