Due to the bugs introduced during the first iteration, being exposed to kickasses should be aovided. Over exposed to those would cause a system failure, which will take months to restart.

Being a slice of annogant, which is the feature introduced during the second iteration, makes the system more efficient under a environment where it exceeds the rests. 

When system fails to restart, try reciting vocabularies.

Being different is very important to the system.

That's the best I can do.

I'm really not good at my work. Work is something that keeps me alive, not living.
