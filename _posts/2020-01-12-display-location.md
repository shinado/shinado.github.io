# Aris weekly

If you're a pro Aris user, you might have noticed there's a cool plugin 'locateme' which displays an image with your current location, like this:

![](/assets/image_locateme.png)

What you may not have known is, when you tap the "send" button and share your location with a friend using Aris themes, with his/her notification turning on, he/she will be able to see your location in the console, just like this:

![](/assets/image_locate_feed.png)

Awesome, isn't it? Now use code 'locateme' and share your location with your friend!
