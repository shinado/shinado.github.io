I swear to god I have read this, comprehensived this thousands of times, yet I can't recall any bit of it every time I come across it, therefore, as stupid as I might sound, I'm going to tape it damn it!!!

String maintains a pool therefore it's immutable, therefore don't put 
>string += 

in the loop otherwise it keeps creating new Strings damn it.
