description: Hardest thing ever, beginning today
categories: Diary

In order to save me from great depression, I've decided to post a diary to record whatever happens to me during the day. This is the hardest thing ever, for me, since I can't stop wondering what does one thing have anything to do with my life. A lot people have failed in it, not because it's hard, but because it's easy. I'm damn sure that in the middle of it, I'm gonna ask myself, what the heck am I doing? What sense is this gonna make? I'm not going to make this happen to me cause I'm sick, I'm so sick of thinking how, of asking why, and I'm gonna do it, every single day for the rest of my life damn it!

As for today. I think I've lost my passion. I've done nothing the whole day, period. 

Do no give up, you pussy!
