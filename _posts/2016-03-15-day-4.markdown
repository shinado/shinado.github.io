This is the last diary on my blog. I've moved all my diaries [here](http://1.yilaunch.sinaapp.com/diary/diary.php), which I'm sure you're not interested in.

The idea of keeping diaries everyday comes from my the idea that a small act every makes great progresses. I'm being too SMART. Being smart is nothing good, at least for me. Being smart makes me focus on BIG things that are beyond my capability and leaves me depressed in the end. 

Anyway, it's a good start.
