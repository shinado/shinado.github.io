# Release note 2.7.2

In our latest release, cd and shell command is back! 

Simply use 'cd {file}' to access to the folder/file; use 'cd..' to go back to parent folder, 'exit' to exit. And that's it! Simple as that.

By using 'shell' you'll be able to enter shell mode where you can use all shell commands. Simply use 'exit' to quit.
