I've been recently practicing observing my mind. It's simple. Just sit tight and write down whatever is in your mind. This afternoon, I experienced something interesting which I believe will help me to find out what's happening to me lately. 

That is, I wrote something I didn't even notice until I finished it. That sentence is 

> YOU ARE GOING TO FAIL ANYWAY

It's very not cool. It's deep in my mind, really. Almost for my whole life I've been thinking about who I am, what I'm going to be, what do I want to do, can I do better...all the stupid questions like that. 

I once did. I once got to know who I am going to be, what I am going to do. It didn't hold for long, unfortunately. Then I got sucked into this black hole called life, or reality or whatever it is. 

The fact is, I'm dumb, I'm lazy, I'm flawful. I'm not the one I once thought I would be. I have to admit that being stupid enough to believe I'm the best one is really great, when I walk on the street, thinking all the eyes on me(not the kind when I hang out on street with my girl friend, in short pants, both of us yellow, in a none-yellow muslim country where tourists never visit) and how cool I was. I really enjoy that. In fact my idea life is simple: being a freelancer. That is exactly what I've been trying for a long time. 

However, when I put it this way, I feel ashamed -- the so called freedom is just a reason of not working hard cause I never think about price of freedom. I got stucked, in a trap I set for myself. If I can just stay foolish I once was, I could live a happy life. The problem is I can't concerntrate. My mind is like a drop of ink in the water, it never stays in a point, it expands.

Now you see me. Now you see where the point is. The only thing that has changed is you. You can't stay focused anymore. You'd rather think about all those nonsense than do something, don't you?

Knock it off. I'm tired... Just leave it, post it... That's it....
